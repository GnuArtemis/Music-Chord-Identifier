# Music-Chord-Identifier

Our goal with this project is to create a simple, accessible tool that can be used for learning basic music theory at an approximately 5th-grade level. By way of a virtual keyboard, users can designate note combinations, and upon submission, an analysis of the chord (as of 9/23/2020, root and quality) will be displayed.

Compared to existing tools, we are prioritizing accessibility: users primarily recieve the simplest, most likely result, displayed as a section on the current page. Users DO NOT need an prior music theory knowledge in order to determine what the result is.

Our MVP is being able to plug in three notes on a keyboard and displaying an exact match if one exists. To do so, we are using www.tofret.com/reverse-chord-finder API.

We are using materialize and an open-source Javascript keyboard to display the page, 

AS A music student
I WANT a tool to help me learn to analyze chords
GIVEN THAT I press notes on a keyboard
THEN I recieve the name of that chord
